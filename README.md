# Variable Declarations
`var` Declare a variable that can be changed later

`let` - Declare a variable that can be changed later ==*Newer*==

`const` - Declare a variable that can not be changed later
> there are some other differences between `var` and `let` to do with **scope** but we won't get into that for now.

7. `Symbol` Used for anonymouse, unique values. (Useful in complex, security-driven applications)
